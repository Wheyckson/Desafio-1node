## :rocket: Sobre o desafio

In this challenge, you must create an application to continue training what you have learned so far in Node.js with TypeScript, using the concept of models, repositories and services!

This will be an application to store incoming and outgoing financial transactions, which should allow the registration and listing of these transactions.
